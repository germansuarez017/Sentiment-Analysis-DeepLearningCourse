# Sentiment-Analysis-DeepLearningCourse
Sentiment Analysis project for Deep Learning in practice Course provided by Marvik consulting firm.

This project uses spanish twitters from different countries from latinamerica and europe, the xml's containing the twitters can be found in the following page http://tass.sepln.org/ or in the XML_files.zip that I have already consolidated them.
The first part of this project aims to predict the sentiment for hispanic twitters using different machine learning models, from LSTM networks to random forests and comparing the different results. For the second part we will try to predict from which country are the twitters coming using mainly a LSTM network.
